  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate and dedicated Web Developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, including
    <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>TypeScript</strong>. My journey in web
    development began as a personal project and evolved into a career driven by a love for creating user-centric, high-quality
    web experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects, building responsive, scalable, and visually engaging websites.
    Currently, I am diving deep into modern frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>, exploring Cloud AI, and expanding my knowledge
    in <strong>Web 3.0</strong> technologies to stay ahead of the curve. I believe in continuous learning and am constantly looking
    for ways to improve my skills and contribute to exciting projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of coding, I am passionate about collaborating with like-minded individuals to solve real-world problems through
    technology. Whether working on a personal project, collaborating with a team, or contributing to open-source, I am always
    eager to build something meaningful and impactful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's work together to bring innovative ideas to life and create the future of the web. I am always open to new
    opportunities, so feel free to reach out and connect with me!
